# Racial Discrimination in the American job market
This work is dedicated to the analyses of racial discrimination in the American job market. 

Researches have assigned identical resumes white- or black-sounding names and have collected data on the success of having a call for interview from the employers.

In this work we used one-tailed tests to identify whether there is an effect on the callbacks for each of the groups (white, black sounding names). The null hypothesis consists on the assumption that there is no effect on the calls. Which means there should be an equal distribution of the calls for both groups.

It was concluded that the difference in the callbacks is statistically significant. The null hypothesis was rejected.

The racial discrimination remains a problem to be resolved.
